Why hello, this is my earnest attempt at finally bringing to all of us the following:

# Democracy

Essentially, a "macro-game" centering around Rock Paper Scissors.

## The Purpose

This has been a brain-child of mine for a solid while, and I've explored several different avenues at realizing it. This time, I think I've finally got it.

In a nutshell, this is a game played once per day where users submit a vote for Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Based on the voting, two are placed against each other, and the winning shape of that match yields the most points to those players, the least points to those who voted for the losing shape, and a bit-more-than-least amount of points for those who voted for the unused shape.

From there, players spend the points to do... things. Oh, and data is collected, all of which gets used to make interesting statistics and draw weird, goofy correlations.

I have various sorts of things that I think could be really fun with this. We'll see how it pans out.

## TO DO

There are a lot of things to do. Lots and lots. I'll be updating this readme as I make headway.

* Create the layout:
    * Header
        * Set up the links
        * Style the links
    * Footer
        * Maybe add a line to separate the footer from the page

* Create the pages:
    * Home page
        * Add text that shows voting numbers
        * Add voting selectors for rock, paper, scissors
        * Add voting button
    * FAQ
        * Write the FAQ
    * About
        * Write the About page
    * User
        * (lots of subpages, TBD later)
    * Data
        * History page
            * (Lots of numerical records, TBD later)
        * Statistics page
            * (Lots of statistical information, TBD later)

* Create the database:
    * Implement Mongoose
    * ... etc?

* Implement login
    * And sessions!
    * This is probably the last phase

* and um...
    * ... whatever else...??
